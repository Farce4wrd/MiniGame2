This is the beginning. A lost room with no windows.

Garage
South 5 East 1
We are in the Garage. A strange place to be in but what's that dreadful sound coming south of us?

Kitchen
North 1 West 4 East 6 South 7
This is the kitchen but it has leads to different places. There is comfort west of us, silence east of us, and enveloping red light south of us.

Bedroom
East 3
Is this peace? No, it doesn't feel right. Something is beneath me. I can see the shadows moving and the sound of footsteps nearby. Move now!

Cavern
North 2
Sublime and breathtaking. This is not a world for me. Find peace elsewhere

Torture Chamber
West 3
The silence envelops me or is it my imagination dying in a place like this? When did it happen? Didnt you follow the silence? Death awaits. You failed!

Balcony
North 3
What a bright sunset! Congratulations, you found peace! That was easy?! Alright, try to find the true danger.
